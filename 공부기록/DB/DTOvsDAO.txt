DTO vs DAO

DAO is a class that usually has the CRUD(create,read,update,delete) operations like save, update, delete.
statement ~~~ DAO
DTO is just an object that holds data. It is JavaBean with instance variables and setter and getters.
metadata ~~~ DTO
The DTO is used to expose several values in a bean like fashion. 
This provides a light-weight mechanism to transfer values over a network or between different application tiers.
DTO will be passed as value object to DAO layer and DAO layer will use this object to persist data using its CRUD operation methods.
